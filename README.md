#Blackjack Project
##Description
Fourth Week Project at Skill Distillery
Simple Blackjack Project with win conditions for the House and Player
This program creates an independent *Deck* class that is not tied to the Blackjack game mode and can therefore be exported for use in other card games with appropriate logic.

The program follows standard Blackjack rules meaning the dealer will draw if the sum of their cards is >17 and stay if its <17. The user may *hit* as many times as they see fit provided they don't go over 21.

##Technologies Used
*Sublime, Java, Eclipse*

##Lessons Learned#
Got comfortable with accessing the fields of classes with objects as fields. Getting in the habit of encapsulating every field. With so much logic I was also able to practice keeping my code readable and understandable in case any bugs came up.
